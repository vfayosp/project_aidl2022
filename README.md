# Introduction and motivation

## Drug discovery

Drug discovery is the process of identifying  potencial new medicines. This process start with **target identification and validation**, after that, several clinical studies and clinical developments are performed before it is registrated and obtains the approval to be released.

Research productivity is known as a time consuming, expensive path, which most of the times end up with very low sucess drug candidates. On this basis, recommender systems have the potential to become useful tools for this process. There are already existing studies applying it to side effects, drug-drug interaction and drug **repurposing**

## Drug repurposing

Drug repurposing consist on identifying new targets for known drugs. In this regards, using an existing drug can save a lot of steps in drug discovery and development proccess.

Among other advantages, it is demonstrated to:

* Reduce R&D costs
* Decrease drug development timeline
* Make clinical trials easier. 
 
Making clinical tries easier is one of the main paths of improvement, since it requires testing medical approaches in people. An offline evaluation, since this project, allows researchers in a medical environment to predict future preferences, which could potentially reduce needed testing in both people and animals.

# Project Goals

* Apply what we learn in the post-graduate program in the medicine field
* Build two recommender systems for drug candidates:

  *   **Protein-drug recommender**: Potential use to link a known target selected (first step in drug discovery process) for a specific disease to an existing drug.
  *   **Drug-disease recommender**: envisioned in the field of drug repurposing or drug reposisioning (exploring the use of drugs already in place to treat other diseases).
