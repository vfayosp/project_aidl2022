# Introduction and motivation

## Recommender systems

A recommendation system is a information filtering system that helps to predict the "preference" between and user and an item. This is used in a wide variety of areas mainly including music, films, books and products.

From an user-product point of view (which is the widely used approach) , recommender system are usually based on :

- **Collaborative filtering**: Builds a model based on user behavior and interactions as well as similar decisions of other users.
- **Content-based filtering**: Uses the characteristics of the item itself to find similar properties between items and recommender them.

</p>

However, it has the potential to be used in several fields, such as the medical field. There are already existing studies about its applications to:

- Side effects
- Drug repositioning
- Drug-drug interaction
- Treatment recommendations.

## Drug discovery

Drug discovery is the process of identifying potential new medicines. This process start with **target identification and validation**, after that, several clinical studies and clinical developments are performed before it is registered and obtains the approval to be released.

<p align="center">

</p>

Research productivity is known as a time consuming, expensive path, which most of the times end up with very low success drug candidates. On this basis, recommender systems have the potential to become useful tools for this process.

## Drug repurposing

Drug repurposing consist on identifying new targets for known drugs. In this regards, using an existing drug can save a lot of steps in drug discovery and development process.

Among other advantages, it is demonstrated to:

- Reduce R&D costs
- Decrease drug development timeline
- Make clinical trials easier.

Making clinical tries easier is one of the main paths of improvement, since it requires testing medical approaches in people. An offline evaluation, since this project, allows researchers in a medical environment to predict future preferences, which could potentially reduce needed testing in both people and animals.

# Project Goals

- Apply what we learn in the post-graduate program in the medicine field
- Build two recommender systems for drug candidates:

  - **Protein-drug recommender**: Potential use to link a known target selected (first step in drug discovery process) for a specific disease to an existing drug.
  - **Drug-disease recommender**: envisioned in the field of drug repurposing or drug repositioning (exploring the use of drugs already in place to treat other diseases).

## Environment setup

For the development of the project the following parameters were used:

<div align="center">

|         Hyperparameter         | Factorization machines | FM with GCN | FM with GCN and attention |
| :----------------------------: | :--------------------: | :---------: | :-----------------------: |
|             Epochs             |          150           |     150     |            150            |
| Learning Rate (Adam Optimizer) |          0.01          |    0.01     |           0.01            |
|              Topk              |           10           |     10      |            10             |
|      Embedding Dimensions      |           32           |     32      |            32             |
|           Batch Size           |          256           |     256     |            256            |
|             Heads              |           NA           |     NA      |             8             |

As it is showed, they remained constant for the training of the models. Just to keep them comparable.

As criterion we used BCEWithLogitsLoss(reduction='mean').

# Data

## Data manipulation

The data was manipulated by the following notebooks:

**1 - Data exploration and cleaning**: Some of the drugs, proteins and diseases were duplicated or triplicated so they were represented multiple times in the data. We kept just one instance of each if the rows or columns were identical and we deleted all the representations if there was a slightly difference. The sparsity of our data was calculated there.

**R script**: We obliged (separately) each dataset to each row to have at least two interactions and to each column to at least have one. We did that not just for the data we cleaned but also computing the transpose to drug_protein in order tdo have protein_drug.

**2 - Data Preparation for the model with context**: We obliged each dataset to each row to have at least two interactions and to each column to at least have one. It has been done in a way that the drugs, diseases and proteins kept are the same in all three dataframes. Also, we divided the data in train and test by selecting randomly one of the interactions of each row and keeping it as test saving the others for train.

Train and test dataframes have been generated with the _random split_ approach [2]. This is based on selecting only one random item of each user for testing.
Although this scheme has been changed to use the last interaction (from time point of view, leave one last item), our dataset and the approach of our analysis do not allow for a the temporal approach.

## Datasets

data/directory contains the following directories:

- **original_data**: where the uncleaned data is stored with the following datasets
- **cleaned_data**: where the cleaned is stored and contains the following datasets (computed using 1 - Data exploration and cleaning)
- **prepared_data**: where train and test are already divided for each dataset (computed using the R script)
- **prepared_data_context**: where train and test are already divided for each dataset in order to use them for the computation with context (computed using 2 - Data Preparation for the model with context)

# Recommender system models

## Factorization machines

Factorization Machines (FM) are generic supervised learning models that map arbitrary real-valued features into a low-dimensional latent factor space [3]. It enhances the linear regression model by incorporating the second-order feature interactions.

FM models represent user-item interactions as tuples of real-valued feature vectors and numeric target variables (similar to a regression or classification models). The base features will be binary vectors of user and item indicators, such that each training sample has exactly two non-zero entries corresponding to the given user/item combination.

In this project an implementation based on the publication by _Rendle, S_[4] will be used.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93614965/156051487-d82a03fd-c020-46fc-890d-6dff592614ac.png" alt="Factorization machines"/>
</p>

## Factorization machines with GCN

Factorization machines assume that each sample is independent and cannot exploit interactions between samples, it is only focused on the features. However, in some applications the interaction between samples is also useful, as in recommendation systems.

Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) allow to capture the correlation between nodes by using a convolution operation. This is performed by aggregating information from the neighbors' information when making predictions so the interaction between nodes is also encoded.
In this project an implementation based on the publication by _Welling et al._ [5] will be used.

## Factorization machines with GCN (with an attention layer)

Factorization machines only incorporate second-order interactions between features, so high-order interactions are not taken into account. FM can model all feature interaction with the same weight but not all interactions are useful and predictive. Therefore, an attention layer to learn the importance of different feature interactions is included [6].

Attention-based layers permit different contribution from parts to be compressed in a single representation.

In this project an implementation based on the publication by _Bengio et al._ [7] will be used.

## Context

In the models explained above the data used consist only on the interactions between items, to those models it is useful add context to the training. The context takes into account the features of each pair of items interaction. This provides to the model extra information that can be used to better recommend the items.

# Metrics, evaluations

- **Hit ratio**: Is is simply the number of correct items that were present in the recommendation list (of length TopK). If the topk is increased the hit ratio increases, but it must be a reasonable value.
- **NDCG** (Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain) :

The cumulative gain is the sum of gains up to the K position in the recommendation list but does not take into account the order. To penalize the gain by its rank, the DCG is introduced, being IDCG the score for the most ideal ranking.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?IDCG(k)=\sum_{i=1}^{|I(k)|}\frac{G_i}{log_2(i+1)}" alt="IDCG"/>
</p>

Then, the NDCG is the DCG normalized by the IDCG so the value is between 0 and 1.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?NDCG(k)=\frac{DCG(k)}{IDCG(k)}" alt="NDCG"/>

# Results

## Protein-drug

The models explained above where applied to the Protein-Drug dataset to build up a recommender system able to recommend drugs starting from a target.

- First approach: Factorization machines model computing embeddings just as a linear layer.
- Second approach: Factorization machines computing embeddings with GCN, to take advantage of the interaction between nodes.
- Finally, in order to capture interaction higher than second order, the attention layer was applied.

The obtained results are showed below:

<div align="center">

|              Model              | HR@10  | NDGC@10 |
| :-----------------------------: | :----: | :-----: |
|               FM                | 0.2264 | 0.2105  |
|           FM with GCN           | 0.6792 | 0.5258  |
| FM with GCN and attention layer | 0.6509 | 0.5259  |

</div>
<div>
 
The attention layer did not show major improvements.   
Here there can be observed how the model performed during training and evaluation.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93614965/157316635-384a6666-b89d-4534-889c-db60fc81a003.png" alt="results"/>
</p>

As it can be observed above, the Factorization Machines model, which corresponds to the baseline model in Recommender system showed the lower performance but improved significantly when including the Graph Convolutional networks to capture the embedding, taking advantage of the fact that the structure of the data in this case allows to improve when capturing interactions between nodes. With regards to the attention layer, it has not improved the metrics.

## Drug disease

The model and approach explained above was replicated for the drug-disease recommender.

<div align="center">

|              Model              | HR@10  | NDGC@10 |
| :-----------------------------: | :----: | :-----: |
|               FM                | 0.0945 | 0.0489  |
|           FM with GCN           | 0.1963 | 0.1272  |
| FM with GCN and attention layer | 0.2092 | 0.1357  |

</div>
<div>

Here there can be observed how the model performed during training and evaluation.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93614965/157317303-c9c03be7-a87a-4b27-8af3-d79e1db43146.png" alt="results"/>
</p>

Here we can also see that applying GCN our model improved considerably. But, in contrasts with the previous model, in this case, adding attention did outperformed, even if just a little, just the FM with GCN. The structure of our data here helped giving attention to the nodes that were closer.

### Comparison against previous research

We have compared our drug-disease results with previous research already done using the same data input. Even the same data was used, we have to consider that different cleaning constraints may have been applied to the data, in terms of removing duplicates or requiring a minimum number of interactions by protein/drug, for each of the datasets.

 The state of the art of recommender systems with this dataset showed major performance that ours. We attributed it mainly to the use of protein interactions as context, which was not implemented in ours. This confirmed that proteins pay an important role in drug development so taking advantage of their interactions with both drugs and diseases is necessary for research in this field.

# Conclusions

- Our main lesson from this project is that knowing not only what is the data, but the structure it has, can help you a lot in the decision of which model is better to implement.
- In our case using a graph convolutional network improved the performance and it was really interesting how this captured the embeddings.
- From our point of view, at least for our problem, using attention is not worth it because of the computational time and the amount of hyperparameter tunning involved compared with the improvement observed.
- Finally, as explained above, we see that the implementation of deep neural networks such as this project may help significantly in several steps of the drug discovery process not only reducing costs and timelines but decreasing the % of candidate drugs that are finally dismissed after such a long timeline and efforts.
