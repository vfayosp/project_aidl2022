# Introduction and motivation

## Drug discovery

Drug discovery is the process of identifying  potencial new medicines. This process start with **target identification and validation**, after that, several clinical studies and clinical developments are performed before it is registrated and obtains the approval to be released.

Research productivity is known as a time consuming, expensive path, which most of the times end up with very low sucess drug candidates. On this basis, recommender systems have the potential to become useful tools for this process. There are already existing studies applying it to side effects, drug-drug interaction and drug **repurposing**

## Drug repurposing

Drug repurposing consist in identifying new targets for known drugs. Among other advantages, it is demonstrated to reduce R&D costs, decrease drug development timeline and makes clinical trials easier. Making clinical tries easier is one of the main paths of improvement, since it requires testing medical approaches in people.

# Project Goals

* Apply what we learn in the post-graduate program in the medicine field
* Build two recommender systems for drug candidates offline evaluation (allow researchers in a medical environment to predict future preferences):

  *   **Protein-drug recommender**: Potential use to link a target selected for a specific disease to an existing drug.
  *   **Drug-disease recommender**: envisioned in the field of drug repurposing or drug reposisioning.
