# Drug recommender system 
Final project for the postgraduate degree in Artificial Intelligence with Deep Learning


### Team members:
Victor Fayos, Jose Mérida, Lucía Pau,Alba Puy
### Advisor:
Paula Gomez

### Framework:
Pytorch

# Project Goals

* Apply what we learn in the post-graduate program in the medicine field
* Build two recommender systems:

  *   **Protein-drug recommender**: Potential use to link a target selected for a specific disease to an existing drug.
  *   **Drug-disease recommender**: envisioned in the field of drug repurposing or drug reposisioning.
